## luxorpen website

the website uses react at its core, but has tons of issues.

it takes more than 30s to load.

Issues:
1. Large size images and gifs (reduce the size of media)
2. unused css and code components. (they also renders with usefull components but never used)
3. Links are not crawlable and no alt tags for image description
